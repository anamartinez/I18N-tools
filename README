1. Verify key presence
It helps you to find missing keys in the YAML file.

### How to run ###
#
# 1. In console run: ruby verify_keys_presence <directory> <options>
# 2. If you only want to find the missing txt.admin keys use option -a
#
# NOTE: It currently only saves keys in the admin.yml file. This will be improved and add as an option
