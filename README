1. Verify key presence
It helps you to find missing keys in the YAML file.

### How to run ###
#
# 1. In console run: ruby verify_keys_presence <directory> <options>
# 2. If you only want to find the missing txt.admin keys use option -a. This will only load keys in the admin.yml file
# 3. If you want to load a whitelist of keys create file named whitelist and put in the same folder as the script. In the file put each key in a different line as follows:
# txt.admin.controllers.tag_controller.open_tickets
# When running the script use option -w to load the whitelist file
